# Glucide-Check
"Glucide-Check" is an iOS native application I developed in Swift, tailored to assist individuals with diabetes. This project marked my first foray into native mobile application development and was designed as a valuable tool for blood sugar management.

##Features
The application is divided into three main tabs, each offering essential functionalities for managing blood glucose levels:

###1. Insulin Calculator
The first tab allows users to input their current blood sugar level and calculate the number of insulin units required to reach an optimal glucose level. In the case of hypoglycemia, the app can also calculate the number of sugar cubes needed to raise blood sugar levels.

###2. Cross Multiplication Tool
The second tab offers a "cross-multiplication" tool, useful for estimating the carbohydrate content in a portion of food. Users input the carbohydrate value per 100g and the amount they wish to eat, and the app calculates the total carbohydrates in the portion.

###3. Settings
The third tab is for configuration. Here, users can enter personal information such as their first name, date of birth, gender, and weight. This allowed me to practice inputting different types of data. Users can also set custom parameters, such as insulin influence on blood sugar, the effect of a sugar cube, and the desired blood glucose target (minimum and maximum levels). Additionally, the app offers customization options for dark mode (light, dark, or following the system setting) and allows changing the app's language.

##Development Highlights
"Glucide-Check" showcases my growing expertise in native mobile application development, demonstrating my ability to create digital solutions that are both functional and useful. This project provided an excellent opportunity to explore native iOS features and to further familiarize myself with mobile development in Swift.
